##WTE - Worst Translations Ever! 

WTE is a plugin that sticks text through multiple rounds of Google Translate, in order to get
some interesting results. It automatically picks a list of languages to go through, and translates
back and forth between them quite a few times. This guarantees that the result will be different
every time.

Any source language [supported by Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/about/intl/en_ALL/#supportedLangs)
is allowed, since auto-detection is used to translate text back to your desired language. This can be set via `config plugins.wte.language`, and defaults to English (`en`).

Samples:

```
<GLolol> %wte This text will be scrambled to near perfection.
<@Atlas> This message was standing almost completely.
```

```
<@Ere> Atlas, wte Mi ne scias la koloro de la hundo FK plugilo, cxar de tio, kio okazis en Islando
<@Atlas> My dick plows Aludra star name I do not know the color of cotton, Iceland
```

```
<GLolol> %wte An evil monster lurks beneath the forest.
<@Atlas> Error Evil Xasa woude.
```
