LinkRelay is an alternative to the official Relay plugin. As Relay can
relay only between channels with the same name, LinkRelay is highly
configurable, and can be used to relay from any channel to any channel.

More over, LinkRelay offers unique features, such as coloring the
non-PRIVMSG messages (i.e. joins, parts, quits, kicks, nick changes, ...),
non-reciprocal relays, or messages filtering (by regexp).

This version of the plugin has been modified by GLolol. Changes made so
far include modified text events, part message filtering, configure nicks
to ignore, etc. Hopefully there'll be more to come. :)
