# SupyPlugins
### GLolol's collection of Supybot plugins...

This repository includes forks/mods of existing Supybot plugins and some that I've written myself over time. All of the code in this repository is considered **experimental** and **not** ready for production use. It may glitch, break, or spontaneously combust at any time. You have been warned!

## List of plugins
Please note that this list may not always be up to date; your best bet is to actually browse the code for yourself! ;)

Any specific plugin dependancies should also be listed.

##### LinkRelay (fork: [ElectronIRC/Otaku](https://github.com/ElectronIRC/Otaku), [ProgVal/Supybot-plugins](https://github.com/ProgVal/Supybot-plugins/tree/master/LinkRelay))
- Mod of the LinkRelay plugin, originally designed for use with [OVERdrive-IRC](http://overdrive.pw/) *(now [replaced](https://github.com/somasonic/ruby-relay))*, with a few extra features such as a configurable list of nicks for the relayer to ignore.

##### Relay (fork: [ProgVal/Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria/tree/master/plugins/Relay))
- Forked by request, adds text events similar to those of the LinkRelay mod above.

##### Hostmasks
- Hostmasks plugin, allows one to fetch idents, hosts, and appropriate banmasks for users.

##### OperUp
- Simple plugin that allows Supybot to oper up on configured networks, automatically (on connect) and manually.

##### Isup
- Provides a simple command to check whether a website is up or down (using isup.me).

##### SupyMisc
- Some assorted commands that don't seem to fit anywhere else.
